Our work uses two different datasets.
One previous published by Mandelli et al. [1] and another collected by the herein work.


To download the datasets please use the following links:
- Mandelli's dataset: [AI-Generated Western Blots](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/nl3txxfovy97b1k/AABqb-gkGBEfjS6pjke3a-d7a?dl=0)

- Our dataset: [Figshare Raw Data Western Blots](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/6gsz6hr2phmu2pfh4el8c/figshare_wb.zip?rlkey=4ip7ocb8iz6yzzmt48htkufhx&st=7z6e0jbp&dl=0)

**Mandelli's dataset** contains 6,000 samples generated by Pix2Pix, CycleGAN, SytleGAN2-ADA, and DDPM.
Besides that data, it also includes 14,200 real-images that were used for training each generator.

**Figshare dataset** contains 6,000 raw data western blots collected from Figshare repository. 
To collect the data, we used the [Figshare API](https://help.figshare.com/article/how-to-use-the-figshare-api), and then extracted the western blots from each downloaded image, using the panel extractor proposed by Cardenuto et al. [2] available at https://github.com/phillipecardenuto/upm/tree/main/panel-extractor.

For each collected image, we include its metadata in the (fold1,fold2)_metadata.csv included in the zip file.

The metadata includes information such as:
- Figure URL
- MD5 (used during figure download)
- Image Name (name of the file used in our collection)
- License (All collected figures are under CC-BY 4.0)



To facilitate the cross-validation protocol, The collected dataset is organized in fold1 and fold2.


After downloading and unzipping each dataset, please organize them as following:
```
